              <strong>I don’t know much about the OMMC. What’s the contest like?</strong>
              <br />
              OMMC is composed of 3 rounds of challenging and thought-provoking questions. Two of these rounds are to be done individually, the third round allows a team of competitors to cooperate on the questions. Each of the individual rounds can be done at whatever time each competitor sees fit within the 4-day testing period, and all members of a team must negotiate one time within the testing period to take the team round. For more information, check out our test info page. The questions themselves have been proposed by a panel of accomplished math students who have participated in numerous math competitions, and test solved by similarly qualified students as well.

              <strong>How will the test be administered? </strong>
              <br />
              Given the current health situation and availability of our resources, the test will be administered over Zoom, and participants will be accordingly monitored. During the four day testing period (February 26th to March 1st), contestants and teams will take each round of the test in one of several moderated Zoom calls to prevent any cheating concerns. Many Zoom calls at different times will be offered to contestants to address time zone and schedule issues, contestants will just choose the one that best suits their interests. Contestants do not have to take the rounds back to back or even during the same call. However, the team round must be taken at the same time for all members of the team. Contestants are required to join one of the Zoom calls whenever they are taking any round of the test. They must keep their camera on for the duration of the test. If a contestant is caught cheating he/she will be immediately disqualified from the competition, and may be barred from participating in future competitions. The test itself will be a timed Google Form implementing Quilgo. It must be stressed again that while participants/teams are given the opportunity to take the test during most hours of the day, they still can only do so when one of the moderated Zoom meetings are being conducted(so if you’re one of those people who like to work at 3 in the morning when none of the staff are awake, you might be out of luck)

              <strong>What are the benefits of participating?</strong>
              <br />
              By participating in OMMC, a competitor gains problem solving and analysis skills that have a number of real-world applications. The problems appearing in OMMC are designed to emulate other prestigious math competitions as well. OMMC exposes competitors to fascinating areas of math that are rarely covered in school. Finally, OMMC is just a lot of fun, and is a great way for students to bond together on something they have a passion for.

              <strong>How do we form teams?</strong>
              <br />
              We are not responsible for forming teams, but we will open a Discord server later on where people can form teams. We also suggest finding your own friends to take the test with! The more people participate, the more enjoyable the contest will be, so spread the word. Note that contestants can register as Solo Individuals, but will be treated as one man teams. They will be given the same amount of time to take the Team Round as all other teams.

              <strong>How do I prepare for the contest?</strong>
              <br />
              The contest questions have a similar difficulty to problems appearing on the AMC 10/12 and AIME competitions. For more information on this, refer to the test format page. Questions on the OMMC draw on a variety of different fields of math, but most importantly require insight, intuition, and reasoning.

              <br />
              You will be required to join one of the Zoom links and keep your camera on for the length of the test. If you are caught cheating you will be immediately disqualified from the competition, and may be barred from participating in future competitions.

              <br />
              The tests will be graded like a typical competition, where you receive points for correct answers and no points for incorrect/ignored answers. You will receive your score around the end of March.
