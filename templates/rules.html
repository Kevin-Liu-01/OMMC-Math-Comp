            <p class="subtitle"><strong>OVERVIEW & PURPOSE</strong></p>
            <p>The purpose of OMMC, or the Online Monmouth Math Competition, is to give talented high school and middle school students an exciting and engaging way to develop their skills in mathematics. Students will have the opportunity to compete in teams, developing valuable teamwork and collaboration skills. In the competition, they will solve thought-provoking challenging mathematics questions The competition consists of 2 individual rounds and 1 team round administered over the span of 4 whole days, consisting of questions with similar difficulty as those posed on the well-established AMC 10/12 and AIME math competitions.</p>
            <p class="subtitle"> <strong>CODE OF CONDUCT</strong></p> 
            <p>As a math competition, we have a commitment to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity, and we expect all competitors to do the same. Cheating in this contest (refer to the competition rules) is extremely frowned upon - the main purpose of OMMC is to foster interest in mathematics and aid in mathematical development, and cheating on this contest helps with none of these things. </p>
            <p class="subtitle"> <strong>CONTEST ELIGIBILITY RULES</strong></p> 
            <p>Contestants must be enrolled in middle school or high school, and should not yet have received a high school diploma. For any gap year exceptions, please contact us for more information. Contestants should also be in teams of 1-4, and working solo is also allowed. Note that any solo competitor will count as their own one man team. They will be allowed to take the Team Round on their own, but will not be given extra time to compensate. They will receive a score on the individual rounds as well as one cumulative score based on all three rounds.</p>

<p> <strong>Practice Integrity.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please practice <strong>integrity</strong> while competing in this event. <strong>Refrain</strong> from using any methods of finding answers, such as searching online, using code, using online/graphing calculators (Symbolab, Desmos, Wolfram Alpha, etc.) or any other methods of <strong>cheating</strong>.</li>
    <li>The only aids allowed on the OMMC (for all rounds) are scrap <strong>paper</strong>, writing <strong>utensils, rulers, compasses</strong>, and a <strong>4-function calculator</strong> (a calculator that can only perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Note that none of the problems appearing on the OMMC require the use of a calculator. </li>
    <li>Remember that this is a <strong>positive</strong> learning environment, and cheating will neither benefit you or the other participants. If any method of cheating is reported, or we find out that a competitor and/or team is cheating, the violatorâ€™s scores will be <strong>invalidated</strong> and they will be <strong>barred</strong>> from this and future OMMC events.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that any attempts to gain <strong>additional time</strong> for a round is also a form of <strong>cheating</strong>, and any answers entered after the set time will be considered <strong>null/invalid</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion</strong> is also a form of cheating. Do not discuss the individual rounds (Rounds 1 and 2) with anyone until discussion is <strong>open</strong> (about a week after the test taking window has closed).

Anyone found discussing the contest before discussion is open may be subject to <strong>disqualification</strong>.</li>
